FIX
-auto guide of homing missile seems off
-powerup time to live does not work properly (they blink but never exipire)
-smoke color not correct on homing missiles

UPGRADE
-updgrade menu with options
  -add debug option
  -pause game on menu enter
  -unpause menu on menu exit if not at new game start
  -maybe even a temporary leaderboard
-bullet collision upgrade
-upgrade powerup
-move asteroids collision check
  -now there are multiple point where we check with asteroid collision(with SAT or with simple circle intersection)
-upgrade score system
  -let score update when asteroid destroyed not when hit -> centralize controls
